# Control Charts

In any manufacturing process, performance must be monitored to ensure that the products being manufactured are not faulty or that the process is not flawed in some way. A common tool used to monitor performance is a *control chart*, in which a series of samples are taken, measured and plotted against calculated limits to observe for signs of a problem.

Variation naturally occurs as a result of random causes in any manufacturing process, referred to as *common cause variation*, and often there is no need for this to be investigated or addressed. This could be, for example, because the variation is within tolerable limits, or the cost of reducing the variation would outweigh the potential benefit of doing so. A process performing in this manner could be described as *under control*.

However, if something occurs within the manufacturing process that results in a significant change in the output, a system, such as a control chart, needs to be in place to raise the alarm that the process may be *out of control*. The process can then be reviewed and any possible *special cause variation* investigated, such as machine wear and tear, poor raw materials, poorly trained operatives, or an accident or malfunction.

## The Principle of a Control Chart {-}

The control chart was invented in the 1920’s by Walter Shewart, who was working for a communications company whose engineers wanted to improve the reliability of their telephone transmission systems. His theory was based around the normal distribution bell curve.

The Advanced Higher Statistics course covers two types of control charts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A Shewart $x$-bar chart for the sample \textbf{mean}.
    \item A Shewart $p$ chart for the sample \textbf{proportion}.
\end{itemize}

In either case, random samples of the product are taken at regular intervals and the sample means or sample proportions are plotted onto the control chart. A line on the chart is drawn to indicate the target value for the population mean or population proportion, as well as $1$-sigma , $2$-sigma and $3$-sigma lines either side of the target value.

The $3$-sigma ($3\sigma$) limits are often referred to as the *upper* and *lower control limits*, with the other limits called *warning lines*.

The Western Electric Company Rules (*WECO Rules*) are commonly used to determine whether the production process is *in or out of statistical control*, and are provided on Page 4 of the SQA booklet of Formulae and Tables.

A process maybe out of statistical control when:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Any} single data point falls outside a $3\sigma$ limit.
  \item \textit{Two out of three} consecutive points fall beyond the \textit{same }$2\sigma$ limit.
  \item \textit{Four out of five} consecutive points fall beyond the \textit{same }$1\sigma$ limit.
  \item \textit{Eight consecutive} points fall on the \textit{same side of the centre line}.
\end{itemize}

## Applying the WECO Rules

Each rule must be carefully checked for to determine whether a process is *in statistical control*. If it is *not* in statistical control, it is often necessary to identify the relevant WECO rule and at which point this could be declared. The following examples focus on context-free control charts for the purpose of practising *applying the WECO rules*.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Example,title filled, colframe=black!50]

## Shewart \textit{x}-bar Charts with a Known Population Mean

Suppose that a manufacturing process is working properly and its performance is normally distributed, with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. If samples of size $n$ are taken regularly from the product, and the mean obtained for each sample, then:

\vspace{-0.5cm}

$$\overline{X}\sim N\left(\mu,\dfrac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)$$

A control chart is created with horizontal lines indicating the population mean and each of the 6 sigma limits calculated. The sample mean for each of the samples drawn at regular intervals is plotted on the chart, and the *WECO rules* applied to determine if or when the production process is out of control.

\textbf{Solution:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] $2\sigma$ limits: $\mu \text{ }\pm \text{ } \dfrac{2\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}=350\text{ }\pm\text{ }\dfrac{2\times 5}{\sqrt{3}}=350\text{ }\pm\text{ }5.77$, so $344.23$ and $355.77$.
    \item[(b)] The process is out of control for samples 6 and 7 as the sample means both lie below the lower control limit ($-3\sigma$ limit). The process needs to be investigated.

## Shewart \textit{x}-bar Charts with an Unknown Population Mean {-}

If the population mean is unknown, the value for $\mu$ must be estimated from the *mean of the mean* of the first few sample measurements, known as $\bar{\bar{x}}$. This situation would be common when a control chart for a manufacturing process is being set up for the first time. 
When $\mu$ is unknown, often $\sigma$ is also unknown. It goes beyond the syllabus for this course to estimate the value of $\sigma$ so it will be stated in the question.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item A new medical manufacturing process is set up to produce a new tablet. In order to ensure the process is in statistical control, a control chart is created from random samples of size 5. The first ten sample means were used to create the target value $\bar{\bar{x}}$ for the chart, and it is known that $\sigma = 0.06\text{ mg}$.

## Shewart \textit{p}-Charts for a Proportion

For some quality control processes the attribute of interest will be a *quality* rather than a numerical value, meaning calculating a mean is not possible. For such cases, a control chart for $x$-bar is not appropriate. Such a *quality* may typically take the form of a binary outcome, such as *defective* or *not defective*. The *proportion* of products within each sample that take a particular outcome (such as *defective*) may instead be calculated, and a control chart for proportion, or $p$-chart, created.

For $np,nq>5$ the distribution of the sample proportion may be described by $\hat{P}\approx N\left(p,\dfrac{pq}{n}\right)$.

This leads to the 3-sigma control limits for a $p$-chart being given, for population proportion $p$, by $p\text{ }\pm \text{ }3\sqrt{\dfrac{pq}{n}}$.

Similarly, the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ limits be be calculated respectively as $p\text{ }\pm \text{ }\sqrt{\dfrac{pq}{n}}$ and $p\text{ }\pm \text{ }2\sqrt{\dfrac{pq}{n}}$.

It should be noted that, depending on the value of $p$, it is not unusual for the lower control limit to be negative or the upper control limit to be greater than 1. When this happens the lower control limit should be given as 0 or the upper control limit given as 1.

If no historical value of the population proportion has been suggested, then $p$ must be estimated from the sample data provided, and $\hat{p}$ used.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Example,title filled, colframe=black!50]
\textbf{Problem:} A machine fills Christmas crackers. 30\% of the crackers are supposed to contain joke A. Every 30 minutes a sample of 50 crackers is taken and the number containing joke A is found. The proportion of each sample that has joke A is plotted on a $p$-chart.

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/1225e.png}

Verify the $3\sigma$ limits on the chart and determine if the $p$-chart is in statistical control for the samples given.

\tcblower
\textbf{Solution:}

$3\sigma$ limits: $p \text{ }\pm \text{ } 3\times\sqrt{\dfrac{pq}{n}}=0.3\text{ }\pm\text{ }3\times\sqrt{\dfrac{0.3\times0.7}{50}}=0.3\text{ }\pm\text{ }0.1944$, so $0.1056$ and $0.4944$.\\
The process is out of statistical control at sample 6 as two out of three consecutive sample means lie above the upper $2\sigma$ limit. The process needs to be investigated.

#### Exercise 13.3 {-}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A manufacturer of orange juice cans claims that, historically, 10\% of the cans produced are defective. 24 samples, each of 50 cans were taken from the production line at daily intervals, and the number of defective cans in the samples were plotted on a $p$-chart.
  
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/1231.png}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Confirm the 1 sigma limits given on the $p$-chart above. 
    \item Explain the value of the lower control limit.
    \item Determine if the $p$-chart was in statistical control for all 24 days. 
\end{enumerate}
    \item A factory machine produces fuses. Historically 3\% of these fuses are defective. Random samples of 100 are taken hourly and the number of defective fuses counted. The p-chart below was created for 24 samples.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item A food retailer insists that the packaging for foodstuffs is produced to a very high-level standard. One of the main supermarkets has asked for evidence of this claim and has sent a manager to the food retailer to inspect the packaging production process. It was decided to create a $p$-chart using random samples of 250 of a particular type of cardboard food container. The target value was estimated using the first 10 samples.

  \item Every hour, 100 small packets of biscuits are randomly sampled from a production line and weighed. A packet is deemed satisfactory if its mass of 25 grams or more, and it is known historically that 92\% of biscuit packets are classed as satisfactory. The proportion of satisfactory packets in 20 successive samples are plotted on the $p$-chart below.
