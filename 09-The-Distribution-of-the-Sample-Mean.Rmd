# The Distribution of the Sample Mean

\vspace{-0.7cm}Previous chapters have investigated probabilities related to *individual* observations from random variables with known distributions. However, statisticians are rarely in the business of making a single observation from a population - instead, they are far more likely to draw a *sample* of observations and, commonly, calculate the *sample mean*. Given random variable $X$, the sample mean of $X$ is also a random variable and is denoted $\overline{X}$. 

Letting $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$ represent a sample of $n$ **independent and identically distributed** (**i.i.d.**) observations, where independence may be assumed through the use of *random sampling* methods, the sample mean may be expressed as:

$$\overline{X}=\frac{1}{n}\left(X_1+X_2+X_3+...+X_n\right)$$

### The Expectation and Variance of the Sample Mean {-}

The expected value of the sample mean is equal to the true value of the population mean, meaning it is an *unbiased estimator* of the population mean. That is, if a series of samples are taken from a distribution with population mean $\mu$ and the mean is calculated for each sample, in the long-run the mean of these sample means tends toward $\mu$.

The *standard deviation of the sample mean* $\overline{X}$ is called the **standard error**. For an underlying population with standard deviation $\sigma$, the standard error of the sample mean for a sample of size $n$ is $\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

**Proof**: Given random variable $X$ such that $\text{E}(X)=\mu$ and $\text{V}(X)=\sigma^2$, from which a sample of $n$ independent observations ($X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$) are drawn:

:::::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.475\textwidth}"}
\begin{align*}
\text{E}(\overline{X})&=\text{E}\left(\frac{1}{n}(X_1+X_2+...+X_n)\right)\\
&=\frac{1}{n}(\text{E}(X_1)+\text{E}(X_2)+...+\text{E}(X_n))\\
&=\frac{1}{n}(n\mu)\\
&=\mu

&=\frac{1}{n^2}(\text{V}(X_1)+\text{V}(X_2)+...+\text{V}(X_n))\\
&=\frac{1}{n^2}(n\sigma^2)\\
&=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}

## The Sample Mean of a Normally Distributed Random Variable

Since the sample mean $\overline{X}$ is a linear combination of independent observations from $X$, **if** $X$ **is normally distributed then** $\overline{X}$ **is also normally distributed.**

\begin{centering}
\tcbset{width=9cm}
\begin{tcolorbox}[adjusted title=Sample mean of normally distributed $X$:, halign title = center,colback=black!5,colframe=black!75, halign = center]
\text{If   }$X\sim \text{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$\text{   then   }$\overline{X}\sim \text{N}\left(\mu,\dfrac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)$
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{centering}

Due to the lower variance of the sample mean, *extreme results are less likely* when taking the mean of a sample in comparison to a single observation. For example, suppose the mass of adult red squirrels in a location is known to be normally distributed, with mean 250 grams and standard deviation 12 grams. If a single squirrel is randomly selected and its mass measured, it would not be that unlikely to encounter a squirrel lighter than 240 grams or heavier than 260 grams. However, if a random sample of three squirrels is taken, each weighed and the mean of the sample calculated then it would be very unlikely for the sample mean to be lower than 240 grams or heavier than 260 grams.

The histograms below show 100 simulated individual observations of squirrel masses compared to the means of 100 simulated samples, each of size 3. Note that the sample means also show a distribution that looks normal with a mean of 250 grams, but that the spread of the sample means is much less than that of the individual observations.

## The Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the most important and useful concepts in statistics. It gives an insight into the prevalence of the normal distribution and, crucially for statisticians, allows the normal distribution to be used for statistical inference even when the data of interest is *not* normally distributed. The CLT says:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.95\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\text{"When the underlying population is }\textit{not}\text{ normally distributed, for sufficiently large sample sizes }\\
\textbf{the sample mean will still be approximately normally distributed.}"
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Note that a *"sufficiently large sample"* in this course is **greater than 20** ($n>20$). Other statistical textbooks may use the value of 30, whilst in reality many statisticians appreciate that the nature of the underlying distribution may allow for smaller samples to be used or require larger samples in order for the distribution of the sample mean to be sufficiently approximately normal.

Proof of the CLT is beyond the scope of this course (and this textbook), but statistical software and/or experimentation can help give a sense of what this looks like in practice. The simulations below show random individual observations from distributions on the left, with corresponding distributions of sample means to the right. Every random sample in both cases was of size 25.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align = 'center'}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
set.seed(234)
X<-sample(c(1:6),50000,replace=TRUE)
barplot(table(X),main="Discrete uniform X",yaxt="n")
set.seed(345)
Xbar<-replicate(5000,mean(sample(c(1:6),25,replace=TRUE)))
hist(Xbar,main="5000 Sample Means for X",yaxt="n",xlab=NA,ylab=NA,breaks=10)
set.seed(456)
Y<-rbeta(50000,2,9,ncp=0)
hist(Y,main="Continuous skewed Y",yaxt="n",xlab=NA,ylab=NA,breaks=100)
set.seed(567)
Ybar<-replicate(5000,mean(rbeta(1000,2,9,ncp=0)))
hist(Ybar,main="5000 Sample Means for Y",yaxt="n",xlab=NA,ylab=NA,breaks=10)
```

The **approximate** distribution of the sample mean can be stated provided the expectation and variance (or standard deviation) of the underlying distribution are known, or can be calculated. The notation '$\approx$' is used to highlight that this is an *approximate* distribution.

        \end{enumerate}
        \item[(c)] The bakery changes its process, and now when a customer orders a number of mince pies the bakery staff places them on a set of weighing scales, one by one. Explain why this change is likely to mean the distribution of $\overline{X}$ is no longer as it previously was.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Let discrete random variable $X$ represent the number of Video Assistant Refereem (VAR) reviews during the course of a game of football, known to follow a Poisson distribution with a mean of 4.5 reviews per game.
    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=8pt]
        \item[(a)] State the distribution of $X$.
        \item[(b)] Calculate the probability that a football game has no more than two VAR reviews.
    \end{enumerate}
    Thirty games are randomly chosen to be studied in greater detail by data analysts. They count the number of VAR reviews in each game, and calculate the mean number of reviews for this sample of thirty games.
    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=8pt]
        \item[(c)] State the distribution of $\overline{X}$, the calculated sample mean.
        \item[(d)] Find the probability that the sample mean calculated is greater than five.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
