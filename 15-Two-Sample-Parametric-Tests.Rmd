# Two-Sample Parametric Tests

Chapter 10 introduced three hypothesis tests which use a single sample of data to assess the evidence for claims relating to the population mean. For example, a study to assess the longevity of a brand's light bulbs might check a random sample of such bulbs, to assess whether the mean lifespan is greater than 1000 hours. The data from the sample is shown below, with the sample mean $\bar{x}$ indicated:

This use of a *single sample* of data, assessing a *single* population parameter, is an example of a **one-sample test**.

Should a study instead wish to compare the longevity of *two different brands' light bulbs* they would instead check *two samples* of data: one sample from *Brand A* and one sample from *Brand B*. In such a case, a typical set of hypotheses might instead ask whether there is evidence to suggest that there is a difference between the population mean lifespan for Brand A, $\mu_A$, and the population mean lifespan for Brand B, $\mu_B$. The data from the samples are shown below, with the sample means $\bar{x}_A$ and $\bar{x}_B$ indicated:

## Two-Sample \textit{z}-test for Population Means

If random samples of data are obtained from each of two populations then, given certain conditions are met, a *two-sample $z$-test* may be used to explore evidence for a difference in the population means.

\begin{centering}
\tcbset{width=14cm}
\begin{tcolorbox}[adjusted title=Conditions for valid use of the two-sample $z$-test for population means:, halign title = center,colback=black!5,colframe=black!75, halign = center]
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{populations} are \textbf{normally distributed}.
    \item The \textit{population standard deviations}, $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$, are \textbf{known}.
    \item The data was obtained through \textbf{random} and \textbf{independent samples}.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{centering}

When the sample sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$ are greater than 20 the *Central Limit Theorem* can be invoked, so the sample means are at least approximately normally distributed regardless of the distribution of the underlying population. Also for sample sizes greater than 20, the sample standard deviations $s_1$ and $s_2$ provide *sufficiently accurate estimates* for the *population* standard deviations $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$.

Given the conditions are satisfied, then the sample means can be described as independent random variables $\overline{X}_1$ and $\overline{X}_2$:

$$\overline{X}_1\sim \text{N}\left(\mu_1,\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}\right) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \overline{X}_2\sim \text{N}\left(\mu_2,\frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}\right)$$

The *difference* between the sample means is also therefore normally distributed:

$$\overline{X}_1-\overline{X}_2\sim \text{N}\left(\mu_1-\mu_2,\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}\right)$$

The distribution of the test statistic is provided in the SQA Data Booklet as:

$$Z=\dfrac{(\overline{X}_1-\overline{X}_2)-(\mu_1-\mu_2)}{\sqrt{\dfrac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}+\dfrac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}$$

Taking a null hypothesis that *the difference between the population means is zero*, or $\mu_1-\mu_2=0$, a more streamlined version can be obtained:

\begin{centering}
\tcbset{width=10cm}
\begin{tcolorbox}[adjusted title=For a two-sample $z$-test for population means:, halign title = center,colback=black!5,colframe=black!75, halign = center]
Test statistic: $z=\dfrac{\overline{x}_1-\overline{x}_2}{\sqrt{\dfrac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}+\dfrac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}$
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{centering}

The null hypothesis above can be rewritten as $\mu_1=\mu_2$, and either one-tailed or two-tailed tests can be performed:

\vspace{-0.5cm}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
        $\text{H}_0:\mu_1=\mu_2$ & \qquad \qquad & $\text{H}_0:\mu_1 = \mu_2$ & \qquad \qquad & $\text{H}_0:\mu_1=\mu_2$\\
        $\text{H}_1:\mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ & & $\text{H}_1:\mu_1>\mu_2$ & & $\text{H}_1:\mu_1<\mu_2$

\textbf{Problem:} To compare the longevity of two brands' light bulbs, a random sample of eight bulbs from \textit{AlwaysBrite} and eight bulbs from \textit{BulbCity} are tested.

    \item The alkalinity, in milligrams per litre, of water in the upper reaches of rivers in a particular region is known to be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 10 mg/l. Alkalinity readings in the lower reaches of rivers in the same region are also known to be normally distributed, but with a standard deviation of 25 mg/l.  Ten alkalinity readings are made in the upper reaches of rivers in the region and fifteen in the lower reaches with sample means of 80.5 mg/l and 99.0 mg/l respectively. Test, at the 1\% level of significance, the claim that the true mean alkalinity of water in the lower reaches of this river is greater than that in the upper reaches, stating an assumption made.
    \item The mass of crisps delivered into bags by a machine is known to be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 0.5 g. Prior to a minor overhaul of the machine, the contents, in grams, of a random sample of six bags are as follows:

Test the hypothesis that the minor overhaul has had no effect on the mean mass of crisps delivered by the machine.
    \item The same test was given to randomly selected groups of 100 scouts and 144 guides. The mean score for the scouts was 27.53 and the mean score for the guides was 26.81. Assuming a common population standard deviation of 3.48, test, using a 5\% level of significance, whether the scouts’ performance in the test was better than that of the guides.
    \item The manager of a lemonade bottling plant is interested in comparing the performances of two production lines, one of which has only recently been installed.

    From past experience with this kind of equipment, it is known that the variance in these figures will be 25 for Line 1 and 10 for Line 2. Assuming that these samples came from normal populations with these variances, test the hypothesis that the two populations have the same mean.
    \item A medical researcher wishes to see whether the pulse rates of smokers are higher than the pulse rates of non-smokers.  Random samples of 100 smokers and 100 non-smokers are selected and the results shown below.
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}

    Determine if the researcher has evidence at the 1\% level that smokers have higher pulse rates than non-smokers.
    \item It is believed that the lengths of new-born babies are normally distributed.  The lengths of a random sample of 44 new-born boys at the maternity hospital in Glasgow were measured with sample mean 51.97cm and standard deviation 2.02cm. A random sample of 41 baby girls was also taken and the measurements of their lengths gave a sample mean of 50.21cm and standard deviation of 1.88cm. Test at the 5\% level the hypothesis that the mean length of the baby boys was longer than that of the baby girls.

## Two-Sample \textit{t}-test for Population Means

When sample sizes are fewer than 20 and population standard deviations are unknown, a one-sample $z$-test for population means is not appropriate. Instead, a *two-sample* $t$*-test for population means* may be used, given certain conditions are met:

\begin{centering}
\tcbset{width=13cm}
\begin{tcolorbox}[adjusted title=Conditions for valid use of the two-sample $t$-test for population means:, halign title = center,colback=black!5,colframe=black!75, halign = center]
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{populations} are \textbf{normally distributed}.
    \item The populations have \textbf{equal variance}.
    \item The data was obtained through \textbf{random} and \textbf{independent samples}.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{centering}

The test statistic is provided in the SQA Data Booklet, and follows a $t$-distribution with $\nu=n_1+n_2-2$ degrees of freedom. It requires calculation of a *pooled estimate of the variance*, $s^2$, and as with the two-sample $z$-test, a more streamline version of the test statistic under a null hypothesis of $\mu_1=\mu_2$ is as follows:

\begin{centering}
\tcbset{width=15.5cm}

## Paired \textit{t}-test for the Population Mean Difference

Suppose six randomly selected athletes have their times to complete a 100 metres sprint recorded, then they each repeat the sprint a month later after some training on technique. Here the two sets of data, *time before* and *time after*, are *not independent*. Instead, each value from the first set of data pairs with a value from the second set; this is called *paired data*. In such a case, the previous two-sample tests in this chapter would be inappropriate. Instead, a single sample of *differences*, $d_i$, for each pair should be calculated and the mean difference assessed using a *paired* $t$*-test*. Possible hypotheses would then related to the population mean difference, $\mu_d$:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
        $\text{H}_0:\mu_d=0$ & \qquad \qquad & $\text{H}_0:\mu_d=0$ & \qquad \qquad & $\text{H}_0:\mu_d=0$\\
        $\text{H}_1:\mu_d \ne 0$ & & $\text{H}_1:\mu_d>0$ & & $\text{H}_1:\mu_d<0$ 
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The test statistic derives from the one-sample $t$-test covered in Chapter 10, with $\bar{d}$ (or $\bar{x}_d$) representing the sample mean difference and  $s_d$ the sample standard deviation in differences.

    Confirm the test statistic given and determine if there is evidence at the 5\% level that the diet has resulted in significant mass gain, stating any assumptions made.
    \item 2.	The percentage body fat of 25 randomly selected eleven-year-old boys was measured before and after an exercise program. The difference for each boy was calculated and the summary statistics were calculated:  
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
        $\Sigma d=-30.2$ & $\Sigma d^2=286.92$
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Test the hypothesis, at the 1\% significance level, that the exercise program has made no difference to the percentage of body fat, stating any assumption made.
        \item Calculate a 99\% confidence interval for the mean decrease in percentage body fat and comment on your answer with respect to part a).

## Review Exercise {-}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item An estate agent compares the selling prices of homes in two neighbouring villages to see if there is a difference in price. The results of the study are shown below, measured in pounds.
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
      \hline
        Village 1 & Village 2\\
      \hline
        $\bar{x}_1=281904$ & $\bar{x}_2=265872$\\
      \hline
        $s_1=30267$ & $s_2=41092$\\
      \hline
        $n_1=35$ & $n_2=40$\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    Determine if there is evidence at the 1\% level to reject the claim that the mean cost of homes in both villages is the same, stating any assumptions made.
    \item A random sample of eleven students sat a Chemistry examination consisting of one theory paper and one practical paper. Their marks out of 100 are given in the table below:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|ccccccccccc|}
      \hline
        Student & A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I & J & K\\
      \hline
        Theory Mark & 30 & 42 & 49 & 50 & 63 & 38 & 43 & 36 & 54 & 42 & 26\\
      \hline
        Practical Mark & 52 & 58 & 42 & 67 & 94 & 68 & 22 & 34 & 55 & 48 & 17\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    Assuming the differences in pairs to be normally distributed, test, at the 5\% level of significance the hypothesis of no difference in the mean mark on the two papers.
    \item Blood pressure levels were measured in a random sample of 19 men with a particular illness, aged 50 to 59 years. The sample mean systolic blood pressure was 146.6 mmHg and the sample standard deviation was 17.9 mmHG. In a second random sample of 15 men, aged 50 to 59 years, in good health, the mean systolic blood pressure reading was 137.4 mmHg and the standard deviation was 15.1 mmHG.\\[1em]
Assess the evidence at the 5\% level that the mean systolic blood pressure in men with the illness is greater than that of men in good health.
    \item In a random sample of 120 workers from a factory in city A, it was found that 5\% were unable to read, while in a random sample of 200 workers from a similar factory in city B, it was found that 11\% were unable to read. Determine whether it be concluded that there is a difference in the proportions of non-readers in the two cities. Test at the 10\% significance level.\\[1em]
    Re-test at the 5\% significance level and comment.
    \item The standard deviation of the scores obtained on a particular test of mathematical ability is known to be 15. A school experiments with a new method of teaching which is supposed to increase general mathematical awareness. A group of 36 students are randomly assigned to one of two classes. The 20 students in Class A are given the new method of teaching while the other 16 students in Class B are taught in the standard way.\\[1em]
At the end of the year, the two classes are given the same test of mathematical ability. The mean for Class A is 120.4 and the mean for Class B is 113.1. Test at the 5\% significance level the hypothesis that the new method leads to a higher mean performance.
