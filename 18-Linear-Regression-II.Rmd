# Further Linear Regression

Linear regression, first introduced in Chapter 5, will be explored in much more detail in this chapter.

## The Method of Least Squares Regression

A straight-line relationship can be valuable in many situations in establishing and summarising the dependence of one variable on another, and in making predictions.

In most experiments, it is assumed that $x$ is under the control of the experimenter and can be known exactly. In such cases $x$ is called the \textit{predictor} (or \textit{independent}) variable. $Y$ is known as the \textit{response} (or \textit{dependent}) variable, and since it is conditional on $x$, $Y$ is a random variable.

The (conditional) expected value and variance of $Y$ is commonly of interest.

$$Y_i=\alpha+\beta x_i+\varepsilon_i$$
 
$\varepsilon$ is a random variables called the \textbf{error} that describes how far $Y$ is from its expected value. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are fixed parameters whose value cannot be known exactly without examining all possible occurrences of $Y$ and $x$. However the sample observations $(x_i,y_i)$ can be used to give estimates $a$ and $b$ of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This leads to the relationship $\hat{Y}_i=a+bx_i$, where $\hat{Y}_i$ denotes the predicted value of $Y_i$ for a given $x_i$.

The method of least squares gives formulae for $a$ and $b$ derived by considering how $\sum \varepsilon_i^2$ might be minimised:

$$b=\dfrac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} \qquad \text{and} \qquad a=\bar{y}-b\bar{x}$$

The above estimates, given on Page 5 of the Data Booklet, rely on several assumptions about the errors, $\varepsilon_i$:

\begin{center}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\varepsilon_i$, are independent.
        \item $\text{E}(\varepsilon_i)=0$
        \item $\text{V}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2$ where $\text{V}(Y)=\sigma^2$
    \end{itemize}
\end{center}

## Contexts for Exercises

The following example and contexts 1 to 5 were all introduced in Chapter 5, and will be used throughout this chapter. For convenience, key summary data and sample statistics previously calculated are provided.

\textbf{Example:} A biology exam consists of two papers: theoretical ($x$) and practical ($y$). The marks scored on each test is obtained for a random sample of 12 students who sat the exam, and a scatterplot is constructed to display the results.

## Calculating the Value of a Residual

For any given $x_i$, the equation of the least squares regression line $\hat{Y_i}=a+bx_i$ gives a \textit{predicted} corresponding value $\hat{Y_i}$, referred to as a \textit{fitted} value, or \textbf{fit}. For any observed data point $(x_i,y_i)$, the value of $y_i$ may be called the \textbf{data} value.

The difference between an observed data value $y_i$ and a corresponding fitted value $\hat{Y_i}$ is called a \textbf{residual}:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[fill=black!10] (8.2,0.8) rectangle (13,2.3);

        \draw[fill=black] (3,2) circle (2pt) node[above] {$(x_i,y_i)$};
        \draw[dashed] (3,1) -- (3,2);

        \node at (12.25,1.2) {$\hat{Y_i}$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

For data points which lie \textit{above} the regression line, their residual is \textit{positive}.

For those which lie \textit{below} the line, their residual is \textit{negative}.

## Estimating the Error Variance

One of the assumptions made for the least squares regression model is that the variance of the errors is a constant for all $x_i$ (and $Y_i$), or:

\vspace{-0.7cm}
$$\text{V}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2 \qquad \left(\text{where }\text{V}(Y_i)=\sigma^2\right) $$

The error variance $\sigma^2$ is estimated by:

\vspace{-0.7cm}
$$s^2=\dfrac{SSR}{n-2}$$

Where the (always positive) \textit{sum of squared residuals}, $SSR$, is calculated as: 

\vspace{-0.3cm}
$$SSR=\sum{ \left(y_i-\hat{Y_i}\right)^2} \qquad \text{or} \qquad SSR=S_{yy}-\dfrac{(S_{xy})^2}{S_{xx}}$$

\vspace{-0.2cm}
Both the formula for estimating the error variance $\sigma^2$ and the more convenient second formula for the sum of squared residuals $SSR$ are given on page 5 of the SQA Data Booklet.

\textbf{Solution:}

\text{(a)   } $SSR=S_{yy}-\dfrac{(S_{xy})^2}{S_{xx}}=256.25-\dfrac{255^2}{290}=32.026$\\[0.5em]

In the case where $\beta=0$ it can be seen that knowing $x_i$ has no value in predicting $y_i$. In other words, a linear regression model is only \textbf{useful for prediction} in cases where the slope parameter is \textit{non-zero}, or $\beta \ne 0$. The \textit{parametric} \textbf{Test for Beta} assesses whether data from a sample provide evidence to suggest that this is the case. The test statistic below follows a $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom, and in this course the test will always be \textit{two-tailed}.

Critical value: $t_{6,0.995}=-3.707$\\

Since $-3.003>-3.707$, do not reject $\text{H}_0$ at the 1\% level of significance. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the slope parameter is not zero, and so no evidence that a linear model would be useful for prediction.

#### Exercise 18C {-}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Six metal plates were immersed in a weak acid solution for various lengths of time. Their percentage losses in mass were then measured and a scatterplot drawn of time in solution ($x$ hours) against mass loss ($y$\%). The equation of the least squares regression line for $y$ on $x$ was obtained.\\[0.5em] 
    \textit{(See Context 1)}\\[0.5em]
    Perform a test at the 5\% level of significance to assess whether there is evidence to suggest that a linear model is useful for prediction.
    \item A scientist is investigating the effectiveness of a particular weed killer. She uses different concentrations of weed killer (mg/litre, $x$) and counts the number of surviving weeds (per 10 square metres, $y$) in a fixed area. The equation of the least squares regression line for $y$ on $x$ was obtained.\\[0.5em] 
    \textit{(See Context 5)}\\[0.5em]
    Assess at the 10\% level of significance whether the linear model is useful for prediction.
    \item The age in months of 30 randomly selected primary school pupils ($x$) and the length of their right foot in centimetres ($y$) were recorded, with the following results:

## Test for the Product Moment Correlation Coefficient $\rho$

Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, $r$, is a sample statistic which measures the strength of the linear association between two variables. It is an estimate of the population parameter $\rho$ (\textit{``rho''}), where $-1\leqslant \rho \leqslant 1$. If $\rho=0$ then there is no \textit{linear} relationship between the variables. Given a sample of bivariate data for which there exists \textit{no} linear relationship between the variables, it is regardless common for the sample to give a \textit{non-zero} value for $r$:

For the linear regression models covered in this course, the coefficient of determination is connected to the *correlation coefficient*, $r$, by a simple relationship:

        \node[right] at (4,0) {$r^2=R^2$};
        \end{tikzpicture}

Everything above implies that $0\leqslant R^2 \leqslant 1$.

## Regression Line of $x$ on $y$

All of the equations of least square regression lines calculated so far have been $y$ *on* $x$ regression lines, calculated with a goal of minimising errors when predicting $y$ *values*.

If there is a need to predict an $x$ *value* based on a $y$ value then it is instead necessary to determine the equation of an $x$ *on* $y$ regression line. This takes the form:

$$\hat{X}=a+by$$

Where the values of $a$ and $b$ for differ from those required for an $y$ on $x$ line, and are given instead by:

$$b=\dfrac{S_{xy}}{S_{yy}} \quad and \quad a=\bar{x}-b\bar{y}$$

## Residual Plots

When considering the use of a linear regression model for bivariate data, it is recommended to produce a plot of *residuals* ($\varepsilon_i$) against *fitted values* ($\hat{Y_i}$), which have been calculated using the sample regression line. The purpose of this is both to ascertain whether a linear regression model is *the most appropriate* model, as well as to judge the validity of several commonly required assumptions, including those required to obtain the estimates for $\alpha$ and $\beta$:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
        $\text{E}(\varepsilon_i)=0$ & $\quad$ \text{and} $\quad$ & $\text{V}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2$
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Below is an illustration of a standard scatterplot showing a sample of bivariate data on the left, with a $y$ on $x$ regression line included, and a residual plot for the same data on the right. The data points highlighted with larger circles on the $y$ against $x$ scatterplot have their residuals similarly highlighted on the residual plot.

It should be observed that the residual plot broadly appears to show:

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
        A random scatter of points... & $\qquad$ & \\
        ...centred on zero... & & $\text{E}(\varepsilon_i)=0$\\
        ...with a constant variance. & & $\text{V}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2$
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{-0.2cm}
This means that the residual plot would give no reason to doubt the assumptions made regarding the errors. This *ideal* residual plot would suggest that the linear regression model is **appropriate**.

The following residual plots are accompanied with relevant comments and suitable conclusions. Note that if *any* of *"random scatter"*, *"centred on zero"* or *"constant variance"* are contradicted then the linear model is *not appropriate*.

The residual plot appears to show a `funnel' shaped pattern of points centred on zero, with variance increasing as the fitted value increases.

The residual plot appears to show a pattern of points following a curve, with variance decreasing as the fitted value increases.

\vspace{-1cm}
\begin{center}
    \begin{align*}
        \text{E}(\varepsilon_i)&\ne0\\
        \text{V}(\varepsilon_i)&\ne \sigma^2

This suggests that the linear regression model proposed is \textbf{not appropriate}.

Use the residual plot to comment on the validity of the linear model.

\tcblower
\textbf{Solution:} The residual plot appears to show a random scatter of points centred on zero, and variance appears to be plausibly constant. The residual plot does not contradict any of the required assumptions for the errors, and so a linear model between English mark and Maths mark can be considered appropriate.

Use the residual plot to comment on the validity of the linear model.

\tcblower
\textbf{Solution:} The residual plot appears to show a random scatter of points centred on zero, with a broadly constant variance as the fitted value increases. This suggests a linear model between stopping distance and speed could be appropriate.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Metal cables are tested under laboratory conditions to determine their breaking strength. Each cable is fixed between two points, and masses attached to the middle of the cable, with the mass steadily increased until the cable breaks. The scatterplot below shows the cable diameter ($x$ mm) against the maximum mass held before breaking ($y$ kg).

    \item A student investigating the relationship between the length of a pendulum and the time taken for one complete swing to occur made a simple pendulum from string and a metal disc, suspended from a clamp over the edge of a table. The time taken for one complete swing ($y$ seconds) was recorded for 12 different string lengths ($x$ cm).

## Confidence and Prediction Intervals

One purpose for adopting a regression approach to examine the relationship between two variables is the wish to predict a value for the response variable ($Y$) given a particular value for the predictor ($x$). 

The least squares regression line equation of $\hat{Y_i}=a+bx_i$ gives an *estimate* for the **mean** value of the response variable for any given $x_i$, whilst the *true* mean response value for a given $x_i$, which is denoted $\text{E}(Y_i\,|\,x_i)$, is unknown. 

It can be desirable to obtain a **confidence interval** for $\text{E}(Y_i\,|\,x_i)$. It can be shown that the *point estimate*, $\hat{Y_i}$, has a sample standard error of:

$$s\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n}+\dfrac{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}}}$$

If the errors, $\varepsilon_i$, are identically and independently distributed as $\text{N}\left(0,\sigma^2\right)$ then the formula below, given on Page 5 of the Data Booklet, can be derived.

\begin{centering}
\tcbset{width=16cm}
\begin{tcolorbox}[adjusted title=A confidence interval for a mean response value, halign title = center,colback=black!5,colframe=black!75, halign = center]
A $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $\text{E}(Y_i\,|\,x_i)$ is given by:\\[1em]
$\hat{Y_i}\,\pm\,t_{n-2,1-\alpha/2}\times s\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n}+\dfrac{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}}}$
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{centering}

As with confidence intervals, the level of confidence relates to the success rate of the *procedure used to generate the interval*, rather than the probability of a calculated interval containing the mean response value $\text{E}(Y_i\,|\,x_i)$.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Example,title filled, colframe=black!50]
\textbf{Problem:} The lengths in centimetres ($x$) and masses in kilograms ($y$) of 12 salmon were measured, with the results:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
        $\Sigma x=30$ & $\Sigma y=540$ & $S_{xx}=12$ & $S_{yy}=4800$ & $S_{xy}=150$
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Construct a 99\% confidence interval for the mean length of salmon with mass 3kg.

\tcblower
\textbf{Solution:}\\

$b=\dfrac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}=\dfrac{150}{12}=12.5, \quad a=\bar{y}-b\bar{x}=\dfrac{540}{12}-12.5\times \dfrac{30}{12}=13.75 \quad \implies \quad \hat{Y_i}=13.75+12.5x_i$\\[0.3em]

$\hat{Y}=13.75+12.5\times 3=51.75$\\[0.3em]

$SSR=S_{yy}-\dfrac{(S_{xy})^2}{S_{xx}}=4800-\dfrac{150^2}{12}=2925, \quad s^2=\dfrac{SSR}{n-2}=\dfrac{2925}{10}=292.5, \quad s=\sqrt{292.5}=17.1$\\[0.3em]

A 99\% CI for $E(Y\,|\,x=3)$ is $51.75\,\pm\,3.169 \times 17.1\times \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{12}+\dfrac{(3-2.5)^2}{12}}=51.75\,\pm\,17.49$\\[0.3em]

So a 99\% confidence interval for the mean mass of a 3kg salmon is $(34.26\text{cm}\,,\,69.24\text{cm})$.

\end{tcolorbox}

\pagebreak

A similar but subtly different goal to predicting a *mean* response value is predicting an **individual** response value for a given $x_i$, denoted as $Y_i\,|\,x_i$. In the context of the previous example, that would be predicting the length of an *individual* salmon. Since the value for a sampled individual can be expected to have more variability that the value of a sample mean, a wider interval around $\hat{Y_i}$ is needed. The required interval is called a **prediction interval**.

\begin{centering}
\tcbset{width=16cm}
\begin{tcolorbox}[adjusted title=A prediction interval for an individual response value, halign title = center,colback=black!5,colframe=black!75, halign = center]
A $100(1-\alpha)\%$ prediction interval for $Y_i\,|\,x_i$ is given by:\\[1em]
$\hat{Y_i}\,\pm\,t_{n-2,1-\alpha/2}\times s\sqrt{1+\dfrac{1}{n}+\dfrac{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}}}$
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{centering}

This formula, also given on Page 5 of the Data Booklet, relies also on the errors, $\varepsilon_i$, being identically and independently distributed as $\text{N}\left(0,\sigma^2\right)$

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Example,title filled, colframe=black!50]
\textbf{Problem:} The lengths in centimetres ($x$) and masses in kilograms ($y$) of 12 salmon were measured, with the results:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
        $\Sigma x=30$ & $\Sigma y=540$ & $S_{xx}=12$ & $S_{yy}=4800$ & $S_{xy}=150$
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Construct a 95\% prediction interval for the length of salmon with mass 4kg.

\tcblower
\textbf{Solution:}\\

$b=\dfrac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}=\dfrac{150}{12}=12.5, \quad a=\bar{y}-b\bar{x}=\dfrac{540}{12}-12.5\times \dfrac{30}{12}=13.75 \quad \implies \quad \hat{Y_i}=13.75+12.5x_i$\\[0.3em]

$\hat{Y}=13.75+12.5\times 4=64.25$\\[0.3em]

$SSR=S_{yy}-\dfrac{(S_{xy})^2}{S_{xx}}=4800-\dfrac{150^2}{12}=2925, \quad s^2=\dfrac{SSR}{n-2}=\dfrac{2925}{10}=292.5, \quad s=\sqrt{292.5}=17.1$\\[0.3em]

A 95\% PI for $Y\,|\,x=3$ is $64.25\,\pm\,2.228 \times 17.1\times \sqrt{1+\dfrac{1}{12}+\dfrac{(4-2.5)^2}{12}}=64.25\,\pm\,42.95$\\[0.3em]

So a 95\% prediction interval for the mass of a 4kg salmon is $(21.3\text{cm}\,,\,107.2\text{cm})$.

\item A running website randomly selected eleven amateur runners who recently completed a marathon and asked them to complete a survey which included their finishing time in the marathon and information about their training routine. The scatterplot below shows, for each runner, their finishing time ($x$, in hours) and the total distance they ran in the final four weeks of their training ($y$, in miles).

A least squares regression line for $y$ on $x$ is shown on the graph, with equation $\hat{Y}=194.8-23.48x$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Calculate the correlation coefficient, and comment on its value.
\end{enumerate}

The website wishes to allow users the ability to input the number of miles in their training plan for the four weeks leading up to the rate, and receive in response an estimate for their finishing time.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(b)] Explain why the equation provided above is unsuitable for this purpose.
    \item[(c)] Obtain a suitable equation which could instead be used.
\end{enumerate}
